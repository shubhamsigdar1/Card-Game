In this project, I Build a card game called war, The way that war is played is that you are playing with someone else and you both draw cards and then compare those cards, the person with higher cards wins, and the cool things about this game is that we keep on track what is happening in the app as long as a user doesn't clear their local storage.

This game works similar to the wordle game, If I close my browser and come back I can still start playing games where I last times stops to play.
